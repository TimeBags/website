# Release alpha.2

It is a working artifact without a very important feature for UX so far - a progress dialog appearing during the ~10 seconds required by the timestamping background process.

I'm not used to multi-thread GUI programming, so this is forcing me to learn many amazing things.

# Anecdote

I aimed to publish the alpha.1 at January 9 - bitcoin birthday.
But I had no time and energy to do it.
Few day later, January 14, a security vulnerability was detected
in PyInstaller, and I discovered it today publishing alpha.1.
So I updated the requirements.txt and
the first release currently published is actually alpha.2.
