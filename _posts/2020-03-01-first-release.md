title: First Published (Alpha) Release
---

# Release alpha.2

It is an up and working artifact without a very important feature for UX so far - a progress dialog appearing during the ~10 seconds required by the timestamping background process.

I'm not used to multi-thread GUI programming, so this is forcing me to learn lots of amazing things.

# Anecdote

My aim had been to publish the alpha.1 on January 9 - bitcoin birthday.
But I had no time and energy to do it.
Few day later, January 14, a security vulnerability was detected
in PyInstaller. I discovered it today while publishing alpha.1.
So I updated the requirements.txt and
the first release currently published is actually alpha.2.
